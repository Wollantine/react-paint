# react-paint
React implementation of a simple paint tool in html5's canvas.

It consists of a canvas, a brush tool with color and width, and undo and redo options.

## How To Run It
Git clone this repository and, inside the folder, do:
```
npm i
npm start
```

Otherwise, I will publish it as a github page in <http://kwirke.github.io/react-paint> for everyone's delight.
